## Synchronization

According to the [Mutex lock for Linux Thread article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mutex-lock-for-linux-thread-synchronization/):

>Thread synchronization is defined as a mechanism which ensures that two or more concurrent processes or threads do not simultaneously execute some particular program segment known as a [critical section][1]. Processesâ€™ access to [critical section][1] is controlled by using synchronization techniques. When one thread starts executing the [critical section][1] (a serialized segment of the program) the other thread should wait until the first thread finishes. If proper synchronization techniques are not applied, it may cause a [race condition][2] where the values of variables may be unpredictable and vary depending on the timings of context switches of the processes or threads.
